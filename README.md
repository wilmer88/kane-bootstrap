# kane-bootstrap

These are the pages I was asked to creat for my bootstrap introduction.

All pages were created with bootstrap components from the get bootstrap page.

The first page is the index. html and it gives info about my background  
and where grew up.
It also has links to my other pages.

The socond page is the portfolio. the porfolio is for past projects, but due to lack of projects
in my resume decided to leave it blank

The third file is the cantact card. html, like the name describes On the contact card it has
links to my other two pages.
index and portfolio.
