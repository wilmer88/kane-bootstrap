# kane-bootstrap

These are the pages I was asked to creat for my bootstrap introduction.

All pages were created with basic bootstrap components from the get bootstrap page.

The index html gives info about my background  
and where grew up, and small thing about me. It also contains a picture of me,
with links to my other pages.

The second file is the portfolio page with images of my past projects
working with html, css and bootstrap. It also contains links to my other two pages

The third file is a basic cantact card, with options to contact a person lol.
Available links to my other two pages. Index and portfolio.
