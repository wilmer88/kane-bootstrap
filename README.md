# kane-bootstrap

These are the pages i was asked to creat.

All pages were created with bootstrap components from the get bootstrap page.


The first page is the index html and it gives info about me 
and where i grew up.
It also has links to other pages


The socond page is the portfolio. due to lack of projects i decided to 
leave it blank

The third file is the cantact card. On the contact card it has prompt for 
name, email, and msg
